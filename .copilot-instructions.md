# AI Assistant Instructions for yt-dlp-ui

## Session Start Checklist
Read these files first:
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` - Project history, architecture, current status
- `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Testing strategy and patterns
- `CI_CD_CHECKLIST.md` - Pipeline status and deployment
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview

## File Update Rules
| Change Type | Update File |
|------------|-------------|
| Features, bugs, architecture | `PROJECT_STATE.md` |
| Tests added/modified | `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` |
| Pipeline, Docker, deployment | `CI_CD_CHECKLIST.md` |
| Major features, setup | `README.md` |

## Session End Checklist
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date in PROJECT_STATE.md
- [ ] Document changes in appropriate .md files
- [ ] Commit all documentation with code changes
- [ ] If UI/backend changed: `docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`

## Git Configuration
- User: `alexholliz`
- Email: `alex.holliz@gmail.com`
- Repository: `alexholliz/yt-dlp-ui`
- Use these for ALL git operations

## Technical Constraints
- **Paths**: Use platform-appropriate paths (auto-detected from environment)
  - Repository location: `~/git/hub/yt-dlp-ui` (same on all machines)
  - Working directory: Available from environment/context
- **Testing**: Use Docker for consistency (`docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app node:20-alpine`)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - avoid heavy packages with native bindings
- **Testing Philosophy**: 95% unit tests (fast, CI), 5% integration tests (local, skip in CI)

## Documentation Style
- Document technical decisions AND alternatives considered
- Add "why" not just "what"
- Keep .md files synchronized with code
- Store lessons learned for future sessions

## Always Remember
1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md at start of every session
2. Update docs as you go, not at the end
3. Rebuild container after code changes
4. Document decisions for future AI assistants
5. Keep tests fast and reliable
