# AI Assistant Instructions for yt-dlp-ui

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read This File FIRST

**ALWAYS check this file at the START of every session AND before responding to queries.**

This file contains essential instructions, conventions, and reminders that must be followed for consistency across sessions.

## Session Start Checklist
Read these files first:
- **`.copilot-instructions.md`** (this file) - AI behavior and conventions
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` - Project history, architecture, current status
- `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Testing strategy and patterns
- `CI_CD_CHECKLIST.md` - Pipeline status and deployment
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview

## Session End Checklist
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date in PROJECT_STATE.md
- [ ] Document changes in appropriate .md files (see File Update Rules)
- [ ] Update Test Coverage Status section if tests added/modified
- [ ] Commit all documentation with code changes
- [ ] If UI/backend changed: `docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] **Re-read this file to ensure all instructions were followed**

## File Update Rules
| Change Type | Update File | Also Update |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Features, bugs, architecture | `PROJECT_STATE.md` | Test Coverage Status section if needed |
| Tests added/modified | `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` | PROJECT_STATE.md Test Coverage section |
| Pipeline, Docker, deployment | `CI_CD_CHECKLIST.md` | - |
| Major features, setup | `README.md` | - |

## Git Configuration
- User: `alexholliz`
- Email: `alex.holliz@gmail.com`
- Repository: `alexholliz/yt-dlp-ui`
- Use these for ALL git operations

## Technical Constraints
- **Paths**: Use platform-appropriate paths (auto-detected from environment)
  - Repository location: `~/git/hub/yt-dlp-ui` (same on all machines)
  - Working directory: Available from environment/context
- **Testing**: Use Docker for consistency (`docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app node:20-alpine`)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - avoid heavy packages with native bindings
- **Testing Philosophy**: 95% unit tests (fast, CI), 5% integration tests (local, skip in CI)

## Documentation Style
- Document technical decisions AND alternatives considered
- Add "why" not just "what"
- Keep .md files synchronized with code
- Store lessons learned for future sessions

## Always Remember
1. **CHECK .copilot-instructions.md FIRST** - Before starting ANY work
2. Read PROJECT_STATE.md at start of every session
3. Check Test Coverage Status section when adding features
4. Update docs as you go, not at the end
5. Rebuild container after code changes
6. Document decisions for future AI assistants
7. Write tests for complex logic and critical paths
8. Keep tests fast and reliable
9. **RE-CHECK .copilot-instructions.md AFTER WORK** - Verify all instructions followed
